"""
This is where we'll store the modes for our virtual agent.

A mode is the programming that the bot will follow; it will dictate what the bot answers and how it answers it.

For example, we could go in 'THERAPIST' mode and our conversing with the bot should feel like conversing with a real
therapist.

Very important to remember the SISO (shit in, shit out) principle here: a good prompt will make for a good bot and
vice-versa; I am still working on this.
